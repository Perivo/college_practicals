### Java Projects Description

1. **Accept integer values for a, b, and c (Quadratic Equation)**:
   - This project accepts coefficients of a quadratic equation from the user and calculates the roots.
  
2. **Accept n strings and sort them in ascending order**:
   - A simple program to accept multiple strings from the user, sort them, and display them in ascending order.
  
3. **Matrix Addition**:
   - Accepts two `n x m` matrices from the user and performs matrix addition.

4. **Addition of Two Numbers**:
   - Accepts two values from the user and calculates their sum.

5. **Animals Package**:
   - Demonstrates the use of a custom package, `Animals`, where an interface `Animal` is implemented by a `Dog` class.

6. **Custom Exception Handling**:
   - Demonstrates how to create and handle your own exceptions in Java.

7. **Java Inheritance (extends keyword)**:
   - Showcases inheritance using the `extends` keyword, with a practical example.

8. **Method Overloading and Method Overriding**:
   - Demonstrates both method overloading and overriding concepts.

9. **Notepad Application using AWT**:
   - A simple Notepad GUI application designed using AWT components.

10. **Simple Calculator using AWT**:
    - A basic calculator GUI that allows users to perform arithmetic operations using AWT components.

11. **Student Registration Form (Resume Builder)**:
    - Using AWT components, a digital form is designed to accept student registration details.

12. **Java List Example**:
    - Demonstrates the methods of Java List Interface, including insertion, deletion, and iteration.

## PHP Projects

The **PHP** folder contains projects covering topics such as session management, cookies, file handling, arrays, and mathematical operations like factorial and Fibonacci.

### Project Structure

└───php ├───Calculating Factorial ├───Displaying Prime Numbers in a Given Range ├───Evaluating Expressions ├───Finding Fibonacci Series ├───Retrieve Records ├───Retrieving Data from HTML Forms ├───Reverse of a Number ├───Storing and Retrieving Cookies ├───Storing and Retrieving Sessions ├───Storing Records ├───Working with Arrays └───Working with Files (Reading/Writing)



### PHP Projects Description

1. **Calculating Factorial**:
   - This script calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user.

2. **Displaying Prime Numbers in a Given Range**:
   - Accepts a range from the user and displays all prime numbers within that range.

3. **Evaluating Expressions**:
   - Evaluates basic arithmetic expressions input by the user.

4. **Finding Fibonacci Series**:
   - Displays the Fibonacci series up to a specified number.

5. **Retrieve Records**:
   - Retrieves records from a MySQL database.

6. **Retrieving Data from HTML Forms**:
   - Demonstrates how to capture data from HTML forms using PHP.

7. **Reverse of a Number**:
   - Reverses a number input by the user.

8. **Storing and Retrieving Cookies**:
   - A demonstration of storing cookies and retrieving their values.

9. **Storing and Retrieving Sessions**:
   - Stores session data and retrieves it for the current user session.

10. **Storing Records**:
    - Stores user data into a MySQL database using PHP.

11. **Working with Arrays**:
    - A series of array manipulations, including sorting, searching, and other operations.

12. **Working with Files (Reading/Writing)**:
    - A simple PHP script that reads data from and writes data to a text file.

## How to Run

### Java Projects

1. **Compile and Run Java Programs**:
   - Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command line.
   - Compile the `.java` files using:
     ```bash
     javac FileName.java
     ```
   - Run the program using:
     ```bash
     java FileName
     ```

### PHP Projects

1. **Set Up XAMPP**:
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to set up a local PHP development environment.
   - Place your PHP project in the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation.
     ```
     C:\xampp\htdocs\php-project-folder
     ```

2. **Start Apache**:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server.

3. **Access the Project via Browser**:
   - Navigate to the PHP scripts using your web browser:
     ```
     http://localhost/php-project-folder/script.php
     ```

### Prerequisites

- **Java Projects**: JDK (Java Development Kit) must be installed.
- **PHP Projects**: XAMPP or another local PHP development environment.
